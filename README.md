CMMC ML1 Web Questionnaire

# About the project

Companies in the US that are doing any kind of contracting with the federal government, specifically the Department of Defense (DoD), will need to go through a Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) process. The CMMC assesses a company’s cybersecurity compliance through three Maturity levels (MLs); a company will be certified for the highest level in which they meet all requirements of the level and preceding levels. Our team’s focus is only helping companies identify if they are certified for CMMC’s Maturity Level 1 through a web based application. ML1 has 17 requirements, outlined in Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) clause 52.204-21, that correspond to security practices for basic safeguarding of Federal Contract Information (FCI). Companies need to not only comply with the requirements but also have policies and generate objective evidence to show that the requirements are being met. Self-assessment of these requirements can be completed through use of a third-party (e.g. Omnistruct).

The value that the client expects from this project is in companies having a method to easily determine which of the 17 requirements for CMMC ML1 they do or do not comply with and providing them with tools to formalize or reach the compliance. An additional value that the client expressed was lead generation for Omnistruct.
